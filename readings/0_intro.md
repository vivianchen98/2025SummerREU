## üéØ Why Pacman?

**Pacman** is a classic arcade-style game where an agent moves through a maze to collect food, avoid ghosts, and navigate walls. But behind this simple gameplay lies a rich environment for studying decision-making.

Pacman makes a good **testbed** because it captures the core challenges that intelligent agents face:

- The environment is **dynamic** and **partially observable**
- The agent must **plan ahead** or **learn from experience**
- Each action involves a **trade-off** between risk and reward

By studying Pacman, you'll explore how agents can:
- Represent and reason about the world
- Search for goal-directed paths
- Learn from feedback to improve performance

## üß≠ What will be covered?


In this 2-week REU project, you'll focus on two core modules:

- üîç **Search**: How agents systematically explore environments to find solutions
- üß† **Reinforcement Learning**: How agents learn to make decisions through experience and feedback
