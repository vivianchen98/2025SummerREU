# Comparing DFS and BFS

Now that you’ve implemented both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), it’s time to take a step back and ask:

> Are these good algorithms?
> Which one is better?

---

## What Does “Good” Even Mean?

Ask yourself:
- What problem is the algorithm solving?
- What would a "good" solution look like?

Write down:
- Does it find a solution at all? (completeness)
- Does it find the best solution? (optimality)
- How much work does it take? (time/memory efficiency)

## Designing Experiments

What experiments can you run to answer these questions? (Think about both qualitatively and quantiatively)

**Qualitative Experiments:**  
- Watch how the algorithm explores the problem.
- Observe the order in which nodes are visited.
- Reflect on the paths found and any patterns.

**Quantitative Experiments:**  
- Measure things like time taken, number of nodes expanded, and memory used.
- Compare the length of solutions found by each algorithm.

## Fill Out the Comparison Table
Based on your experiment results, you should be able to fill in this table:

| Aspect           | DFS | BFS |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Completeness      |                  |                  |
| Optimality        |                  |                  |
| Time Efficiency   |                  |                  |
| Space Efficiency  |                  |                  |
| Works well when…  |                  |                  |
| Struggles when…   |                  |                  |
